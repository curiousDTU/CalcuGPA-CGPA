# CalcuGPA-CGPA
As a college student, it’s important to keep track of your academic performance,  
and one of the key metrics used to measure your progress is your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).  
    
Calculating CGPA can be a time-consuming and complex task, especially if you have taken multiple courses  
with varying credit load and grading systems. However, with the help of a CGPA calculator,  
the process can be much simpler and more efficient.
